# Simple REST API with Node.js

This project is a simple RESTful API built using pure Node.js, without any external frameworks.
Itâ€™s part of my learning journey to strengthen my backend development skills and understand how servers work at a lower level.

## Features

- Built entirely with Node.js (no frameworks)

- Handles basic CRUD operations

- Uses native Node.js modules (http, fs, etc.)

- Clean and modular structure

- Easy to extend for future improvements

## Tech Stack

- Node.js

- JavaScript

## Project Setup

# Clone the repository

git clone https://github.com/Ibnballo1/node-rest-api

# Navigate to project folder

cd node-rest-api

# Run the server

node server.js

Or with
pnpm dev

The API runs on http://localhost:5000 by default

# Notes

This project demonstrates the fundamentals of building REST APIs from scratch using only Node.js core modules.
Iâ€™m currently expanding it with features like routing, data persistence, and request handling improvements.
